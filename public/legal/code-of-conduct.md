# Code of Conduct and Diversity & Inclusion Statement

ThePew is intended for communication and collaboration. We value the participation of each member and want all participants to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all participants are expected to show respect and courtesy to other participants. All participants, attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers, users, and volunteers at any facet of ThePew are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers and administrators will enforce this code.

## Code of Conduct

The Organizer is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. The Organizer do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form, nor do we tolerate any behavior that would reasonably lead to another event participant being made to feel unsafe, insecure, or frightened for their physical or emotional well-being.

All communication should be appropriate the audience, including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others such as attendees, participants, speakers, users. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

Harassment can also take the form of attendees soliciting business or making sales pitches to fellow attendees during the event, known in the industry as “suitcasing”. While we encourage our attendees to engage in lively professional conversation, this behavior is not appropriate on ThePew, such content can be removed at the sole discretion of the Organizer. It is not an appropriate time nor venue to attempt to buttonhole or hard sell your fellow participants.

Each user of ThePew is entirely responsible for his or her own actions.

Participants violating these rules will be kicked out of ThePew at the sole discretion of the Organizer.

Thank you for helping to make this a welcoming, friendly space for all.

## Contact Information

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the Organizer via the application.

The Organizer will be happy to help participants contact security or local law enforcement or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe. The Organizer and ThePew greatly value your participation.

## Diversity & Inclusition Statement

We believe the best communities are composed of a broad range of people, with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and viewpoints.

P99 CONF seeks to engender and maintain a diverse, welcoming, inclusive and equitable environment for each member of the community, including all staff, speakers and attendees. This holds true whatever their race, ethnicity, national origin, religious beliefs, age, gender, sexual orientation or identity, disability, neurodiversity, marital status, status of parenthood or pregnancy, medical conditions, military service or veteran status, physical appearance, or other unique personal characteristics. We fully respect any other status protected by laws of the country in which our conferences and programs are being held.

We want each participant to feel valued, respected, and enfranchised to participate. We are committed to nondiscriminatory practices in all the work we undertake and we expect members of our community to likewise respect the work, lives and livelihoods of others.

We further recognize that there are technical industry and societally systemic issues that have often denied participation, representation and opportunities to certain classes of individuals, thus we seek to actively hold space for and include voices that have historically been underrepresented.

We expect professional, civil and respectful behavior from all participants and do not tolerate harassment of or by P99 CONF attendees, speakers or staff. All P99 CONF participants are bound by the Code of Conduct for the event and any media used in association with it (including any online platforms, social media, discussion forums or channels, emails, etc.).

Anyone witnessing or subject to unacceptable behavior should contact the P99 CONF event organizers via community@scylladb.com.
