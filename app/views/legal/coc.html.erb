  ThePew is intended for communication and collaboration. We value the participation of each member and want all participants to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all participants are expected to show respect and courtesy to other participants. All participants, attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers, users, and volunteers at any facet of ThePew are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. 
</p>
<p class="mb-3 font-light text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
  Organizers and administrators will enforce this code.
</p>
<h2 class="my-4 text-3xl font-extrabold leading-none tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-white"> Code of Conduct</h2>
<p class="mb-3 font-light text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
  The Organizer is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. The Organizer do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form, nor do we tolerate any behavior that would reasonably lead to another event participant being made to feel unsafe, insecure, or frightened for their physical or emotional well-being.
</p>
<p class="mb-3 font-light text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
  All communication should be appropriate to the audience, including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others such as attendees, participants, speakers, users. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.
</p>
<p class="mb-3 font-light text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
  Harassment can also take the form of attendees soliciting business or making sales pitches to fellow attendees during the event, known in the industry as “suitcasing”. While we encourage our attendees to engage in lively professional conversation, this behavior is not appropriate on ThePew, such content can be removed at the sole discretion of the Organizer. It is not an appropriate time nor venue to attempt to buttonhole or hard sell your fellow participants.
</p>
<p class="mb-3 font-light text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
  Each user of ThePew is entirely responsible for their own actions.
  Participants violating these rules will be kicked out of ThePew at the sole discretion of the Organizer.
</p>
<p class="mb-3 font-light text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
  Thank you for helping to make ThePew a welcoming, friendly space for all.
</p>
<h2 class="my-4 text-3xl font-extrabold leading-none tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Contact Information</h2>
<p class="mb-3 font-light text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
  If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the Organizer via the application.
</p>
<p class="mb-3 font-light text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
  The Organizer will help participants to contact security or local law enforcement or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe. The Organizer and ThePew greatly value your participation.
</p>
<h2 class="my-4 text-3xl font-extrabold leading-none tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Diversity & Inclusition Statement</h2>
<p class="mb-3 font-light text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
  We believe the best communities are composed of a broad range of people, with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and viewpoints.
</p>
<p class="mb-3 font-light text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
  The Organizer and ThePew seek to engender and maintain a diverse, welcoming, inclusive and equitable environment for each member of the community, including all staff, speakers and attendees. This holds true whatever their race, ethnicity, national origin, religious beliefs, age, gender, sexual orientation or identity, disability, neurodiversity, marital status, status of parenthood or pregnancy, medical conditions, military service or veteran status, physical appearance, or other unique personal characteristics. 
</p>
<p class="mb-3 font-light text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
  We fully respect any other status protected by laws of the country in which our conferences and programs are being held.
</p>
<p class="mb-3 font-light text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
  We want each participant to feel valued, respected, and enfranchised to participate. We are committed to nondiscriminatory practices in all the work we undertake and we expect members of our community to likewise respect the work, lives and livelihoods of others.
  We further recognize that there are technical industry and societally systemic issues that have often denied participation, representation and opportunities to certain classes of individuals, thus we seek to actively hold space for and include voices that have historically been underrepresented.
</p>
<p class="mb-3 font-light text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
  We expect professional, civil and respectful behavior from all participants and do not tolerate harassment of or by attendees, speakers or staff. All participants are bound by the Code of Conduct for the event and any media used in association with it (including any online platforms, social media, discussion forums or channels, emails, etc.).
</p>
<p class="mb-3 font-light text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
  Anyone witnessing or subject to unacceptable behavior should contact the event organizers via the app.
